# bflat
BFlat combines the simplicity and efficiency of simple, schemaless formats with the ability to manage binary data
and preserve the full precision of numeric values.

It's fast. It's precise. It's simple. It's self-describing.

BFlat is designed to be ideal for low-latency, high-throughput messaging that requires binary data or requires messages to preserve
the precision and type of numeric values.
