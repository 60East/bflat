title: BFlat: Modern Binary Messaging
---

BFlat combines the simplicity and efficiency of simple, schemaless formats with the ability to manage binary data and preserve the full precision of numeric values.

It's fast. It's precise. It's simple. It's self-describing.

BFlat is designed to be ideal for low-latency, high-throughput messaging that requires binary data or requires messages to preserve the precision and type of numeric values.
